# âš¡ MacOS Terminal Portfolio â€” My Flavor

This ainâ€™t your average portfolio.  
Itâ€™s a macOS-inspired terminal that **talks back**, powered by AI, rocking dynamic wallpapers, and a slick dock.  
Originally cooked up by [Johnny Culbreth](https://github.com/johnnyculbreth) â€” I hacked it, tuned it, and made it mine.

- Fresh **welcome screen** & terminal commands
- Dock cleanup + my own shortcuts
- SEO tuned for my world
- Wallpapers & little UI magic âœ¨
